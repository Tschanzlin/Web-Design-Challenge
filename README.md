# Web-Design-Challenge

This challenge consists of 7 different .html files used to create the web page presentations of the Weather Py data, one for each page (landing page, four pages summarizing latitude vs. specific weather condition, a comparisons page, and data page).  

There are two other files used to create the content for the pages:
- Jupyter notebook to create pandas data tabel
- Data1.html file which is the DataFrame_to_html output file

Bootstrap was used to format the .html files, with heavy reliance on the navbar, container, and table functions to format each page.

I contemplated using a weather themed background for the webpage, and you'll note a commented area in the Index.html file that  allows for the addition of a background.  i found the presentation to be cleaner wihtout the background and chose to to with a simpler and cleaner presentation.
